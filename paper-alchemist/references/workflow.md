## Prepare the corpus

Run from the research project where `.paper-alchemist/` should live:

```bash
paper-alchemist distill <paper-folder> --profile <name> --language auto --ocr auto
```

Use `--language en` or `--language zh` only when the user explicitly wants to override detection. Use `--update` only for an existing profile the user asked to refresh.

Use `--ocr auto` to OCR only low-text PDFs, `--ocr always` for image-heavy pages whose text layer is incomplete, or `--ocr never` to disable OCR. OCR requires `pdftoppm` and `tesseract`; Chinese OCR also requires the `chi_sim` language pack. Do not install those tools silently.

Read the JSON result and inspect `.paper-alchemist/profiles/<name>/source-manifest.json`. Report excluded files and their reasons. Check `content_mode`, `ocr_used`, and extraction warnings. Do not claim that a scanned or low-text PDF was distilled when OCR was unavailable or unsuccessful.

The command creates:

- private extracted text and batch packets under `.paper-alchemist/cache/<name>/`;
- one private observation record per paper and recognized module under `.paper-alchemist/cache/<name>/observations/`;
- deterministic seed profiles under `.paper-alchemist/profiles/<name>/<lang>/modules/`;
- source and quality manifests under `.paper-alchemist/profiles/<name>/`.

## Review private packets

Process one language and module at a time. Read packet files under:

`.paper-alchemist/cache/<name>/packets/<lang>/<module>/batch-*.md`

For each source in a packet, complete its matching private observation record under:

`.paper-alchemist/cache/<name>/observations/<lang>/<module>/<document-id>.md`

Replace pending markers and set `observation_status: complete`. Use the completed observation records, rather than raw passages, when merging corpus-level findings.

For each packet, record only aggregate observations:

- rhetorical moves and their typical order;
- paragraph roles and transitions;
- stance, voice, tense, hedging, and claim strength;
- citation and quantitative-evidence placement;
- figure/table introduction, cross-reference, comparison, and interpretation patterns;
- module-specific comparison or analysis patterns;
- reusable checks and failure modes.

Do not create phrase banks from the papers. Do not quote long passages. Treat filenames as evidence labels, not as author personas.

## Complete module profiles

Edit `.paper-alchemist/profiles/<name>/<lang>/modules/<module>.md` using the quantitative `.seed.md` file as evidence. Preserve YAML fields and every required H2 heading listed in [schemas.md](schemas.md).

Replace all `Pending Agent synthesis` markers with corpus-level findings. Set:

`synthesis_status: complete`

Keep claims proportional to `source_count` and `confidence`. For fewer than three sources, label findings tentative. When sources disagree, describe the variation instead of forcing a false rule.

Complete all eight modules for both languages. A zero-source module must remain low-confidence and explicitly state that no corpus evidence is available.

## Integrate bilingual profiles

After module profiles are complete, run:

```bash
paper-alchemist integrate --profile <name>
paper-alchemist validate-profile --profile <name>
```

`integrate` must refuse any module whose `synthesis_status` is `pending`, `stale`, missing, or invalid. Complete the listed modules and retry; never treat the quantitative seed as a semantic profile.

Review and refine the generated files:

- `en/integrated.md`
- `zh/integrated.md`
- `bilingual/cross-lingual.md`
- `bilingual/conflicts.md`

Align only high-level functions across languages. Keep target-language surface conventions dominant. Preserve conflict notes when English and Chinese corpora favor different paragraph lengths, voice, directness, or citation placement.

## Confirm completion

Run `paper-alchemist validate-profile --profile <name>` after integration. Extraction output, generated seed files, or `valid: true` alone do not mean distillation is complete. The profile is ready for generation only when the validation result contains:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "semantic_complete": true,
  "integration_complete": true,
  "generation_ready": true,
  "incomplete_profiles": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

If `generation_ready` is false, continue the modules named in `incomplete_profiles` and resolve `errors` before integrating and validating again. Warnings do not always block generation, but report them to the user, especially low-confidence or single-language evidence.

Never tell the user that distillation is complete without reporting the profile name, profile directory, `generation_ready` value, and warnings.

## Update an existing profile

Run `distill ... --update`. Unchanged documents reuse cached extraction. Changed and new documents are reprocessed. Read `semantic_refresh_required` in the command result and re-synthesize those module profiles before integration.

The CLI fingerprints evidence per language and module. It preserves completed profiles and integration artifacts when the relevant evidence is unchanged, and marks affected profiles `stale` when evidence changes.

Never overwrite a completed semantic profile with a quantitative seed without reviewing it.

## Privacy and failure handling

- Keep `.paper-alchemist/cache/` out of version control.
- Do not copy source papers into the profile or skill.
- Retain figure/table-heavy PDFs when extraction yields sufficient text. If they lack conventional sections, use their evidence only for `results-analysis` observations and explicitly note limited prose evidence.
- Stop and report password-protected, corrupt, unsupported, or still-low-text files after the selected OCR policy runs.
- Treat OCR as text recovery, not as authorization to infer unlabelled values from chart geometry or images.
- If extraction yields fewer than two recognizable paper modules, exclude it as insufficient structure unless it is classified as a figure/table-heavy visual supplement; visual supplements contribute only to `results-analysis`.
- If one corpus language is missing, finish the available language and mark bilingual integration as degraded.
